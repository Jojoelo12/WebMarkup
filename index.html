                    Race cars rely on the airflow pressing on them to generate traction, a phenomenon known as downforce. There are two ways to generate downforce: place the wings on top of the car, or create a low pressure zone below to suck the car down onto the track. The latter gets the job done with minimal additional resistance. 
                    In 1978 the British F1 Brabham team pushed the aspiration concept to its limits with their BT46B. Designer Gordon Murray (who later designed the McLaren F1 supercar) added a fan, which sucked air from underneath the car through the engine compartment. A similar idea was previously tried by American designer Jim Hall on his Chaparral 2J, in the Can-Am series.
                    The Brabham BT46B made its debut at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix and was driven to victory by Niki Lauda after qualifying third. He and team-mate John Watson had been instructed by the Brabham buyers to take it easy during qualifying so as not to shake hands with the team. It was probably a good idea. Taking advantage of a loophole, Murray argued that the fan was primarily to cool the engine. Other teams failed and the anger grew after Lauda's win. Brabham boss Bernie Ecclestone, once a politician, decided to retire the BT46B.

                More power is always good, but what about more wheels? So thought the designer Derek Gardner. His Tyrrell P34 had a pair of normal tires in the rear, but four 10-inch wheels in the front. How is that possible? Gardner said the four small front tires gave more grip, but perhaps there was also an aerodynamic advantage, as the smaller tires nestled neatly behind the front wing. In any case, the P34 was not a success. In two competitive seasons (1976 and 1977), he won just one race. But the P34 remains one of F1's most iconic cars.
                Tyrrell's lack of success didn't stop other teams from testing the six-wheel concept. March introduced a car with four large rear wheels in 1977, but could not find the financing to finish it. Ferrari toyed with the idea of ​​putting four wheels on a single rear axle, like a "dualie" pickup. Finally, in 1982, Williams built a six-wheel prototype, the FW08B. Like the March, it had two wheels in the front and four in the back, all the same size. 
                Williams believed the six-wheel design would make it easier to pack aero gear and had promising early results in testing. But the FW08B never raced. The six wheels were banned before the 1983 season.

                Modern F1 cars are all about aerodynamics. But now that most of the low-flying fruit has been banned or outright exploited, it's all about incremental improvements. That is why today's F1 cars are adorned with add-ons that look like Chihuly carbon fiber sculptures and why they are equipped with short fins. 
                Shark fins were introduced as part of a major overhaul of the F1 car design rules for the 2017 season. The hood fins are designed to work with smaller rear wings, slightly altering the aerodynamic comparison. Some teams have been trying to find performance improvements with the new configuration. Others found the wings a convenient place to put car numbers.
                However, the shark fins disappeared after just one season. They just proved unpopular with the teams, some of whom thought they made the cars look ugly. In what was ultimately the deciding vote, McLaren boss Zak Brown complained that the shark fins didn't leave enough room on the car for sponsor logos.
