                    <h3>Why was the invention made?</h3>

                <p>
                    A frequent spectator of F1 knows that the cars are made to go as fast as possible. That's exaclty the reason for all these inventions. These car components are created to make the car go faster. This might be on a straight, through corners, in difficult weather or on different sets of tires.
                    From a hybrid engine to ground effect. The innovations these F1 teams made were to out perform their rivals. Not always with succes. Some with to much succes, resulting in being banned a short while after first usage.

                    <h3>What is the advantage of the innovation?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    To understand why these innovations were created we firstly need to understand one thing. Each formula 1 team has a different approach to building in a car. All the cars are different. Because of that, not all the innovations work on all the cars. Each innovation is is specifically made for that car.
                    Now that we understand that we can take a look at all the innovations. The only innovation made for all the teams was the V6 Turbo Hybrid Engine. This was a result of modernising the sport and making it fair for everyone. If we look al the innovations made by the teams, they are made to complement their car.
                    So if a team for example struggles with grip in high speed corners, they might innovate a car part which increases their grip in high speed corners. For example, the fan on the brabham. This fan sucks air from underneath the car into the engine. As a result the engine gets cooled down which lowers the risk of overheating and this also creates a low pressure zone underneath the car, resulting in a car sucking to the ground the faster in goes.

                    <h3>How do the innovations get used?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Like said before all the innovations are produced to make a specific car go quicker. Cars that lack in certain areas get innovations in those areas to gain an advantage. The example given before, the fan on the brabham, was made to give the car an advantage in the corners where it struggled before. Another innovation made was by Mercedes, it was called the DAS System (Dual Axis Steering). What this innovation did was change the camber angle of the front tires by pushing and pulling the steering wheel. 
                    During safetycars or warm up laps the driver would pull the steering wheel towards himself. This resulted in a less of an angle for the camber. Meaning there was more tire surface on the track. This made it easier to warm the tires. Once the warm up laps or safetycars was ending. The driver would push the steering wheel back into the original position. Reverting the camber back to optimal for that track. Because of this in the early stages of the race restarting the Mercedes cars were way quicker then other cars.

                    <h3>Who is using the innovations?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    All of the innovations are used by different teams. Depending on the team that made the innovation. It should be pretty obvious that the drivers are the first when it comes to using the innovations as they are driving the car. Secondly the team makes use of the innovations but not all the teams make use of these innovations. If a team doens't have enought money to innovate they can't innovate at all. Which means that they won't use any innovations at all. 
                    Because of this the teams with the most money usely also have the most innvations as they can constantly innovate their car and make it go quicker. Because this can offer an unfair advantage for smaller teams with no money. The FIA introduced the cost cap in 2021. Resulting in holding back the top teams and giving the smaller teams an inch to improve if they can.

                    <h3>What are the expectations for the innovations?</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Each of the innovations has to go through a couple of tests to be legalised. F1 is made up of a lot of rules and every rule has to be be complied with to be a legal part. Lots of innovations get theorized but don't make it onto the car because of their legality. Only the parts that are declared legal will be put on the car. This doesn't mean that they are on the car forever. Teams can put up a objection to the part if they think that they are rule breaking or a loophole. The FIA has to look at the part again and once again declare it legal or not.
                    The general expectations for these innovatios are that not all of them will be seen by the public. Because of legality reasons or because it is a car part that you simply can't see. Nowadays F1 cars make pretty heavy use of the floor underneath the car to generate as much ground effect as possible. Because of this the teams upgrade the floor often and these changes are updates we can't see.

                    <h3>The future for the innovations.</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The future is pretty bright for all the innovations that are being made these years. A goal of Formula 1 is to have a 0 emmision scheme in place for 2030. This makes the sport much more endurable and less toxic for the environment. F1 is also growing in popularity pretty hefty. This means that more money will come in and the cost cap might go up. Technology is becoming more complex each day. This means that technology is also becoming more expensive. Because the growth in popularity of F1 the technology that will be available in the next years is affordable. 
                    F1 is a representation of technology that will be put in road cars years after their first appearance in F1. The better the technology in F1 the better and safer the cars are in the next years. This means that F1 could give a better viewpoint to improve the road cars we have nowadays.
